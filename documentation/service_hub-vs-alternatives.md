# 🍱 Service-Hub vs. Alternatives

JovianX Serivce-Hub offers a very simply way to create Self-Serivce experience for apps on Kubernetes. 


With Service-Hub you can create applicaiton tempaltes, and provide them as Self-Service applications to users (technical or non-technical), no extra DevOps magic glue reuqired to get started.

We love all of the alternatives/proxy tools in our space, and there are plenty. Our focus is on simplicitly, great developer experience, and a very short time-to-value.
