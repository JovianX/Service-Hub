# 🍱 Service-Hub vs. Alternatives

JovianX Serivce-Hub offers an effortless way to create a Self-Serivce experience for apps and infrastructure with Kubernetes.

With Service-Hub you can create service templates, and provide them as Self-Service applications to internal stakeholders (technical or non-technical), no extra DevOps magic glue is required to get started.

Our focus is simplicity, excellent developer experience, and a short time-to-value. We love all of the alternatives/proxy tools in our space, and there are plenty.
