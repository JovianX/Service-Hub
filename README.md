# What is JovianX Service Hub?
JovianX **Service Hub** is a self-service portal. It exposes an on-demand catalog of infrastructure services (for example databases, s3 buckets, Airflow workflow execution, Jenkins Pipelines, services with or without pre-configured or pre-loaded datasets, etc) via a simple self-service UI and CLI. 

Service Hub is commonly used by Platform and DevOps Engineers.


## Use Cases
- **Self-service infrastructure** Enable internal stakeholders to easily and efficiently create their infrastructure.
  - **Jenkins** pipeline execution self-service
  - **S3 Bucket** creation via self-service
  - **RDS** Creation via self-service 
- **Development environments**  Shorten the development cycle with self-service app & infra components via UI/CLI/IDE.
- **Testing and review environments** Allow non-technical stakeholders (such as Product Management, Sales, and Support) to review development progress early in the development cycle.

- **RBAC** - Role-based access control
- **Login with Google**
- **Installation via Helm Chart**

# How does Service Hub work?
Service Hub allows internal users to create services from a catalog. The catalog is based on service templates that you can create and manage. 
A template defines 4 optional elements: 
- **Inputs**  define the user inputs to collect from the user.
- **Components** define what components should be set up when instantiating the service.
- **Hooks** can run scripts or trigger external APIs and services during different service lifecycle events (create, delete, etc).
- **Outputs** define the output shown to the users after they create their service.

Service Hub has native integration with Kubernets, thus components can set up Helm charts, and Hooks( such as pre-install, post-delete, etc') can setup Kubernetes Jobs.

When a user creates a service from the templates catalog, Service Hub generates a web-form UI from the *Inputs* definition, asking the user to provide inputs to complete service creation. When the the user provides the input values Service Hub passes the provided values to the Components and hooks, allowing the creation of pre-scripted services following inputs end-users provide.
